    <p>To get a little more about me, I'm currently 21 years old.</p>
    <p>Living in Denver Colorado.</p>
    <p>I started my schooling right as I got out of highschool in 2020, unfortantly that was during the pandemic.</p>
    <p>It was challenging though I've continued onwards and been making great strides.</p>
    <p>I've currently been averaging a +3.0 GPA across ACC and CSU-Pueblo.</p>
    <p>Though Best Buy I'm reconized as a top revenue performer even though being part time.</p>
    <p>And last May, (May, 2023) I gained my masters title in my Taekwondo studio after 16 log years.</p>
    <p>I'm increadibly excited to see where this Cyber Security field can take me as I love technology and want to continue learning everything that I can!</p>

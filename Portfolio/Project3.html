    <h1>Mock Pentesting Project</h1>
</header>

<Main>
<p>Within one of my college class our final project was doing a mock pentest on a site and give a proper review on the site.</p>
<p>We created a full topology of the network without knowledge of what devices were there.</p>
<p>We conducted a fake interview with our professor on the company security guidelines as well.</p>
<p>We created a renewed network topology and recomendations on what needed to be done to create a better secure network.</p>
<p>I learned a ton from this final project as we would conduct another actual pen test with the department of commerce in Castle Rock to see if they followed proper guidelines.</p>

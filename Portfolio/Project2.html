        <h1>Home Network Set up and New Workstation Project!</h1>
    </header>

    <Main>
    <p>One of the most recent project was utilizing what we've learned from a project management class and utilizing it in the real world.</p>
    <p>I created a new workstation.</p>
    <p>This included building a new PC, creating a NAS within my workstation, and utilizing a Meraki Firewall to properly configure and secure my station.</p>
    <p>Currently it's still under process as the only step is creating my NAS system.</p>
    <p>It was my first time building my own PC from scratch.</p>
    <p>It was also my first time setting up a physical firewall within a network as well!</p>
    <p>I'm excited to continue my project as time goes on!!!</p>
